# DevOps Technical Challenge

This repository provides the application code needed to execute the technical challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to gauge your maturity in various DevOps practices, so donâ€™t hesitate to showcase all your knowledge ;).

**Note:** The estimated time to carry out the challenge is 3 days. Don't worry if you can't finish the test, try to focus on your strengths and propose as much as you can!


## Technical Challenge

Deploy the provided application according to these requirements:

- The application must run in a high-availability configuration.
- The application must be accessible to the public.
- The application's supply chain and infrastructure should be secured against various attack vectors.

## Steps

1. **Select a Runtime Platform:**
   - Choose a runtime platform of your preference to deploy the provided application.
   - Employ an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach to deploy the necessary infrastructure.

2. **Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Select your preferred CI/CD platform and establish a CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application onto the chosen runtime platform.
   - Incorporate all the stages that you deem essential for the process.

3. **Implement Observability:**
   - Choose an observability stack and a set of signals to monitor your application's health.
   - Develop the resources that you consider best suited for this purpose (dashboards, alerts, etc.).

## Deliverables

1. **Configuration Files:**
   - Upload the various configuration files to this repository and push them.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Include any necessary documentation in this repository to highlight important aspects of your solution.

## Recommendations

1. **Local Installation Option:**
   - If using any public cloud platform is not feasible, consider a local installation using options such as Minikube or Rancher.
   ***Note***: In this scenario, you still need to outline the approach to create the infrastructure using IaC.

2. **Code Practices:**
   - Uphold good code practices by:
     
     a. Making distinct commits for different configurations according to their scope.
     
     b. Maintaining a clear directory structure to store the various configurations. 

Feel free to demonstrate your depth of knowledge and experience by optimizing, securing, and documenting your work in a clear and comprehensive manner. Best of luck!
